<hr>

rayml is an AutoML library which builds, optimizes, and evaluates machine learning pipelines using domain-specific objective functions.

**Key Functionality**

* **Automation** - Makes machine learning easier. Avoid training and tuning models by hand. Includes data quality checks, cross-validation and more.
* **Data Checks** - Catches and warns of problems with your data and problem setup before modeling.
* **End-to-end** - Constructs and optimizes pipelines that include state-of-the-art preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, and a variety of modeling techniques.
* **Model Understanding** - Provides tools to understand and introspect on models, to learn how they'll behave in your problem domain.
* **Domain-specific** - Includes repository of domain-specific objective functions and an interface to define your own.

## Installation 

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rayml/):

```bash
pip install rayml
```

or from the conda-forge channel on [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rayml):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge rayml
```

### Add-ons
**Update checker** - Receive automatic notifications of new Woodwork releases

PyPI:

```bash
pip install "rayml[update_checker]"
```
Conda:
```
conda install -c conda-forge alteryx-open-src-update-checker
```

## Start

#### Load and split example data 
```python
import rayml
X, y = rayml.demos.load_breast_cancer()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = rayml.preprocessing.split_data(X, y, problem_type='binary')
```

#### Run AutoML
```python
from rayml.automl import AutoMLSearch
automl = AutoMLSearch(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train, problem_type='binary')
automl.search()
```

#### View pipeline rankings
```python
automl.rankings
```

#### Get best pipeline and predict on new data
```python
pipeline = automl.best_pipeline
pipeline.predict(X_test)
```
